Browser-specific:
- Closing monitor doesn't work, gets platform not supported exception. Check for fix in similar issue for ReactiveUI handling of commands etc.

Information area:
- The tabbed information area below emulator view currently expands horizontally without limits. It should be the same width as the emulator view (and scrollable horizontally if needed).
 
AvaloniaCommandTarget
- Make rendering via C64 Commands Provider work with AvaloniaCommandTarget. Correctly map C64 screen codes to the font used.
