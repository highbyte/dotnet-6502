A [6502 CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) emulator for .NET

What it (currently) does/is
- .NET 5 cross platform library written in C#
- Emulation of a 6502 processor
- Supports all official 6502 opcodes
- Can load an assembled 6502 program binary and execute it
- Passes this [Functional 6502 test program](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests)
- Monitor (rudimentary)
- **_A programming excerise, that may or may not turn into something more_**

What's (currently) missing
- A way for input/output other than loading files to memory and inspecting memory after execution
- Decimal mode (Binary Coded Decimal) calculcations
- Support for unofficial opcodes

What it isn't (and probably never will be)
- An emulation of an entire computer (such as Apple II or Commodore 64)
- The fastest emulator

Inspiration for this library was a [Youtube-series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJgsuQoy9bc&list=PLLwK93hM93Z13TRzPx9JqTIn33feefl37) about implementing a 6502 emulator in C++

# How to use Highbyte.DotNet6502 library from a .NET application
## Reference NuGet package
Add GitHub Packages source _(if/when this package will live on nuget.org, this would not be needed)_
``` powershell
dotnet nuget add source https://nuget.pkg.github.com/highbyte/index.json --name "github-highbyte" --username [your-git-username] --password [your-git-personal-access-token]
```
Add reference to the NuGet package in your application
```
dotnet add package Highbyte.DotNet6502 --prerelease
```

## Or compile .dll yourself
- Clone this repo ```git clone https://github.com/highbyte/dotnet-6502.git```
- Change dir to library ```cd dotnet-6502/Highbyte.DotNet6502```
- Build library ```dotnet build```
- In your app, add .dll reference to ```./bin/Debug/net5.0/Highbyte.DotNet6502.dll```

## Example of basic usage of library

Example #1. Load compiled 6502 binary and execute it.
```c#
  var mem = BinaryLoader.Load(
      "C:\Binaries\MyCompiled6502Program.prg", 
      out ushort loadedAtAddress);
      
  var computerBuilder = new ComputerBuilder();
  computerBuilder
      .WithCPU()
      .WithStartAddress(loadedAtAddress)
      .WithMemory(mem);
      
  var computer = computerBuilder.Build();
  computer.Run();  
```  

Example #2. 6502 machine code for adding to numbers and dividing by 2
```c#
  // Test program 
  // - adds values from two memory location
  // - divides it by 2 (rotate right one bit position)
  // - stores it in another memory location

  // Load input data into memory
  byte value1 = 12;
  byte value2 = 30;
  ushort value1Address = 0xd000;
  ushort value2Address = 0xd001;
  ushort resultAddress = 0xd002;
  var mem = new Memory();
  mem[value1Address] = value1;
  mem[value2Address] = value2;

  // Load machine code into memory
  ushort codeAddress = 0xc000;
  ushort codeInsAddress = codeAddress;
  mem[codeInsAddress++] = 0xad;         // LDA (Load Accumulator)
  mem[codeInsAddress++] = 0x00;         //  |-Lowbyte of $d000
  mem[codeInsAddress++] = 0xd0;         //  |-Highbyte of $d000
  mem[codeInsAddress++] = 0x18;         // CLC (Clear Carry flag)
  mem[codeInsAddress++] = 0x6d;         // ADC (Add with Carry, adds memory to accumulator)
  mem[codeInsAddress++] = 0x01;         //  |-Lowbyte of $d001
  mem[codeInsAddress++] = 0xd0;         //  |-Highbyte of $d001
  mem[codeInsAddress++] = 0x6a;         // ROR (Rotate Right, rotates accumulator right one bit position)
  mem[codeInsAddress++] = 0x8d;         // STA (Store Accumulator, store to accumulator to memory)
  mem[codeInsAddress++] = 0x02;         //  |-Lowbyte of $d002
  mem[codeInsAddress++] = 0xd0;         //  |-Highbyte of $d002
  mem[codeInsAddress++] = 0x00;         // BRK (Break/Force Interrupt) - emulator configured to stop execution when reaching this instruction

  // Initialize emulator with CPU, memory, and execution parameters
  var computerBuilder = new ComputerBuilder();
  computerBuilder
      .WithCPU()
      .WithStartAddress(codeAddress)
      .WithMemory(mem)
      .WithInstructionExecutedEventHandler( 
          (s, e) => Console.WriteLine(OutputGen.FormatLastInstruction(e.CPU, e.Mem)))
      .WithExecOptions(options =>
      {
          options.ExecuteUntilInstruction = OpCodeId.BRK; // Emulator will stop executing when a BRK instruction is reached.
      });
  var computer = computerBuilder.Build();

  // Run program
  computer.Run();
  Console.WriteLine($"Execution stopped");
  Console.WriteLine($"CPU state: {OutputGen.GetProcessorState(computer.CPU)}");
  Console.WriteLine($"Stats: {computer.CPU.ExecState.InstructionsExecutionCount} instruction(s) processed, and used {computer.CPU.ExecState.CyclesConsumed} cycles.");

  // Print result
  byte result = mem[resultAddress];
  Console.WriteLine($"Result: ({value1} + {value2}) / 2 = {result}");
```  
generates this output
``` console
C000  AD 00 D0  LDA $D000  
C003  18        CLC        
C004  6D 01 D0  ADC $D001  
C007  6A        ROR A      
C008  8D 02 D0  STA $D002  
C00B  00        BRK        
Execution stopped
CPU state: A=15 X=00 Y=00 PS=[-----I--] SP=FD PC=0000
Stats: 6 instruction(s) processed, and used 23 cycles.
Result: (12 + 30) / 2 = 21
```

## Example applications
### SadConsole - graphical console
Example of a [SadConsole](https://sadconsole.com/) game loop running compiled 6502 [assembly code](Examples/SadConsoleTest/AssemblerSource/hostinteraction_scroll_text_and_cycle_colors.asm) in the emulator, using a shared memory area between emulator and SadConsole for updating the SadConsole window. The implementation is a bit rough, subject for improvement. Currently only tested on Windows.

``` 
cd ./Examples/SadConsoleTest
dotnet run
```

### Standard OS text console
Some example 6502 assembly programs running in the emulator from a standard OS console application.

[Examples/ConsoleTestPrograms](Examples/ConsoleTestPrograms)
- Run16bitMultiplyProgram.cs
- HostInteractionLab_Scroll_Text.cs
- etc.

Staring executing code at c000
Stopped at                0000
c00b  00        BRK
```

Example how to show contents of bytes in memory with ```m``` command:

_Inspects values A (d000), B (d001), and result (d002)_
```

d000  12 30 21
```


# How to develop
- Use Windows, Linux, or Mac.
- [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) installed.
- Develop in VSCode (Windows, Linux, Mac), Visual Studio 2019 (Windows), or other preferred editor.

# Tests
Most of the code has been developed with a test-first approach.

The [XUnit](https://xunit.net/) library is used.

## Unit tests
To run only unit tests:

```powershell
dotnet test --filter TestType!=Integration
```

## Functional (integration) test
There is a special XUnit test that is running the test code found here: [Functional 6502 test program](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests/blob/master/6502_functional_test.a65)

The purpose of it is to verify if an emulator (or real computer) executes the 6502 instructions correctly.

Notes on the special functional/integration XUnit test 
- it downloads the [Functional 6502 test program](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests/blob/master/6502_functional_test.a65) from the repo
- it modifies the .asm source code to disable Decimal tests
- it compiles the .asm source code with the AS65 assembler (bundled in the repo above)
- it loads the compiled 6502 binary into this emulator, and runs it.
- this emulator is configured to stop executing when the program reaches a specific "success" address (where the program loops forever).
- it currently requires a Windows machine to run due to the AS65 assembler. There may be a Java-version of it that could possibly be used instead.

To run only the special functional/integration XUnit test:

```powershell
dotnet test --filter TestType=Integration
```

## Code coverage report locally
