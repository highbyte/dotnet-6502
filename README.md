## A [6502 CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) emulator for .NET

# Overview / purpose

- A collection of .NET cross platform libraries and applications for executing 6502 CPU machine code in different contexts. Links below for details on each library/app.

- **_A programming exercise, that may or may not turn into something more_**

- A main library [```Highbyte.DotNet6502```](Highbyte.DotNet6502/CPU_LIBRARY.md) for executing 6502 machine code, not bound to any specific computer, and does not have any UI code.

- A machine code monitor library [```Highbyte.DotNet6502.Monitor```](Highbyte.DotNet6502.Monitor/MONITOR.md) used as a base for specific UI implementations.

- A library [```Highbyte.DotNet6502.Systems```](Highbyte.DotNet6502.Systems/SYSTEMS.md) containing implementations of specific computers ("Systems") that runs on a 6502 CPU.

- Several libraries [```Highbyte.DotNet6502.Impl.*```](Highbyte.DotNet6502.Impl/RENDERERS_AND_INPUTHANDLERS.md) that implements rendering and input handling using different technologies (such as Skia, Blazor, SadConsole) per emulated System.

- Several UI applications [```Highbyte.DotNet6502.Apps.*```](Highbyte.DotNet6502.App/APPS.md) that are the hosts for emulating the Systems above and their different rendering techniques.

# What's currently missing
Including but not limited to:
- 6502 CPU
  - Decimal mode (Binary Coded Decimal) calculations
  - Support for unofficial opcodes
- Systems
  - C64: Emulation of graphics mode, sprites, cycle-exact rendering, etc.

# What this isn't (and probably never will be)
- An emulation of all aspects of computers such as Apple II or Commodore 64.
- The fastest emulator.

# How to develop
For requirements and local development setup, see [here](DEVELOP.md)

## Assemblers
Was used during development to compile actual 6502 source code to a binary, and then run it through the emulator.

## Monitors / Emulators
Was used during development to test how certain instructions worked when in doubt.
